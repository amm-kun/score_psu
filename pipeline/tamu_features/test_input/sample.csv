Plate Size and Color Suggestibility: The Delboeuf Illusion‚Äôs Bias on Serving and Eating Behavior,Van Ittersum,Koert,2012,10.1086/662615,0093-5301,Journal of Consumer Research,JournConsRes,Journal of Consumer Research,gw38,FALSE,"Van Ittersum, Koert; Wansink, Brian",Plate Size and Color Suggestibility: The Delboeuf Illusion's Bias on Serving and Eating Behavior,JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH,English,,VISUAL ILLUSIONS; BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST; PORTION SIZES; ASSIMILATION; VOLUME; DIMENSIONS; PERCEPTION; JUDGMENTS; CONTOUR; SHAPE,"Despite the challenged contention that consumers serve more onto larger dinnerware, it remains unclear what would cause this and who might be most at risk. The results of five studies suggest that the neglected Delboeuf illusion may explain how the size of dinnerware creates two opposing biases that lead people to overserve on larger plates and bowls and underserve on smaller ones. A countercyclical sinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware. Although these serving biases are difficult to eliminate with attention and education, changing the color of one's dinnerware or tablecloth may help attenuate them. By showing that the Delboeuf illusion offers a mechanistic explanation for how dinnerware size can bias serving and intake, we open new theoretical opportunities for linking illusions to eating behavior and suggest how simple changes in design can improve consumer welfare.","[Van Ittersum, Koert] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Wansink, Brian] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Van Ittersum, K (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.",koert.vanittersum@mgt.gatech.edu; wansink@cornell.edu,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2012,39,2,10.1086/662615,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000306373600001,215-228,Van Ittersum,Koert,12-Aug,Van_Ittersum_JournConsRes_2012_gw38,A countercyclicalsinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and therelative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware.,A countercyclical sinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware.,1,655,(x1: 497.25 y1: 296.67) (x2: 523.21 y2: 318.29),"When the diameter ratio between the target serv-ing size and the dinnerware is:H1a: smaller than 0.5 (but larger than 0, which is typ-ical with larger dinnerware), consumers servemore than the target serving size.H1b: larger than 0.5 (but smaller than 1, which is typicalwith smaller dinnerware), consumers serve lessthan the target serving size. | When the diameter ratio approaches zero (i.e., the di-ameter of the serving size approaches zero) or one (i.e., thediameter of the serving size approaches the diameter of thedinnerware), perceptual biases disappear because there is nolonger contrast and assimilation.

Primarily, it was labeled as “Pneumonia of unknown etiology.”[2] Later, the human coronavirus (CoV) was found as the causative agent, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) by the experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses).[3] Later, on February 11, 2020, the WHO announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a COVID‐19.[2]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,,,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,,,
"Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-United States, February 12-March 16, 2020.",,,2020,   ,na,,,,,,,,,,,,"Globally, approximately 170,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including an estimated 7,000 deaths in approximately 150 countries (1). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger persons (3). Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥60 years; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person aged ≤19 years (3). In this report, COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during February 12–March 16, 2020 and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death) were analyzed by age group. As of March 16, a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases in the United States had been reported to CDC, with multiple cases reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities (4). Overall, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged ≥65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged ≥85 years. In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged ≤19 years. Similar to reports from other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,Something about medicine,,,,,,,
