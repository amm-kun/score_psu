weight the two percentages to make their evaluations.","Cues endogenous to the communication of those percentages also influence the weights applied, according to whether the two percentages appear presented at the same time (simultaneously) or temporally separated (sequentially) and whether the first percentage is larger or smaller.","Depending on both the presentation mode and the ordering, consumers use different processes.","In addition to providing practical guidance, this article extends understanding of anchoring and adjustment processes; information presented simultaneously leads consumers to anchor on the first piece of information.","Sequential presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments.","In addition to the underlying theory for these effects, this article delineates some boundary conditions and reveals the effects on consumers' evaluations and choices, with findings from

consumers likely anchor on the first percentage and adjust insufficiently for the second percentage.","Previous research indicates that people often anchor on the first piece of information they encounter, then use it as a basis to form their judgments.","They then may adjust (if insufficiently) for subsequent information.","For example, Tversky and Kahneman (1974) show that timeconstrained participants give very different estimates of 8!, depending on the presentation order (1 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 3 \u00c2 4 \u00c2 5 \u00c2 6 \u00c2 7 \u00c2 8 vs. 8 \u00c2 7 \u00c2 6 \u00c2 5 \u00c2 4 \u00c2 3 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 1).","Because people focus on initial numbers to generate their overall estimates, the descending sequence produces higher estimates.","Although anchoring effects in evaluations of multiple percentages have not been investigated, these effects are robust across a wide variety of contexts (Bagchi and Davis 2012; Epley and Gilovich 2010; Hogarth and Einhorn 1992;Kardes and

differently) and another claim tested by randomly assigned data (i.e., descriptive representation in the group matters), our analysis is relatively straightforward.","To gauge how particular subgroups evaluate the deliberative process relative to their converses (i.e., women vs. men; young vs. not young; non-whites vs. whites; no college degree vs. college degree), we regress each of our three outcome variables on a dummy for sub-group membership, the proportion of the discussion group who are members of the subgroup, group size, and a dummy variable for each polling site.","Positive coefficients indicate that members of each subgroup rated the small group deliberation more highly than their relatively more advantaged counterpart.","Figure 1 presents the results of these regressions for each group of interest on each measure of the small group deliberation process (see online supplemental appendix for the full regression results).","For example, women ranked the groups on average 0.37 points higher on the 10-point scale than men, but evaluated their effectiveness on the group discussion an average of \u22120.13 points lower on the efficacy scale.","With only two exceptions (females on feeling efficacious and the less educated on feeling respected), Figure 1 provides evidence that participants from the politically less influential groups evaluated the deliberation experience more favorably than their more influential counterparts and argues against the notion that deliberation will recreate unequal-and presumably unpleasant-experiences for members of these subgroups.","4 While several are statistically significant, these differences are not substantively large.","For instance, the question regarding small group experience has a standard deviation of 1.88, but the detected average difference between women and men is only 0.37.","That is, the difference between men and women constitutes only 20% of the standard deviation in evaluating the small group experience.","The proportions for other subgroups are even smaller.","As a proportion of overall variance the biggeststill relatively small-difference on feeling efficacious is by
